# FUZZY-LOGIC-VS.-DEEP-LEARNING-A-COMPARATIVE-STUDY-FOR-IMAGE-BASED-POTHOLE-DETECTION-IN-MICHIGAN
This research presents a comparative study of a Mamdani-based Fuzzy Logic system and deep learning models (VGG-16 and ResNet-50) for pothole detection on Michigan road images. The fuzzy system utilizes engineered image features such as intensity, texture variation, edge density, and shape descriptors to perform interpretable rule-based classification. Its performance is evaluated against transfer learning-based CNN architectures to analyze differences in accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness. The study highlights the trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that while deep learning achieves higher accuracy, fuzzy logic remains suitable for lightweight and edge-based applications.
